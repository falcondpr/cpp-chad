1. **Create Repository**

   Start by creating a new repository on GitHub.

2. **Initialize Local Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine and set up the initial project structure.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

3. **Project Structure**

   ```
   ├── README.md
   ├── src
   │   └── hello.cpp
   └── .gitignore
   ```

   - **`README.md`**: This is the main README file that serves as a guide for the project.

   - **`src`**: Directory for source code files.

     - **`hello.cpp`**: Initial "Hello World" C++ program.

   - **`.gitignore`**: File to specify which files and directories to ignore in version control (e.g., compiled binaries).

# C++ Learning Guide

Welcome to the C++ Learning Guide repository! This guide is designed to help you learn C++ programming from basics to more advanced topics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

### Hello World

Let's start with a classic "Hello World" program in C++.

#### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
````

2. Compile and run the `hello.cpp` program.

   ```bash
   g++ -o hello src/hello.cpp
   ./hello
   ```

3. You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```

## Next Steps

Explore more C++ topics by navigating through the source code files and READMEs in this repository. Happy learning!

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Compile and run the "Hello World" program:

   ```bash
   g++ -o hello src/hello.cpp
   ./hello
   ```

You can expand this repository by adding more C++ source code files, each demonstrating different concepts and topics in C++ programming. Update the `README.md` accordingly to guide learners through the repository.

Feel free to modify and enhance this structure as needed for your learning guide. As you progress, you can add more content, examples, and explanations to help learners grasp various aspects of C++ programming. Good luck with your C++ learning journey!
